    "A *package manager* is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, and removing packages.\n",
    "Conda, with its \"``conda install``\", \"``conda update``\", and \"``conda remove``\" sub-commands, falls squarely under the second definition: it is a package manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the confusion here comes from the fact that Conda *is* tightly coupled to two software distributions: [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) and [Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html). Anaconda is a full distribution of the central software in the PyData ecosystem, and includes Python itself along with binaries for several hundred third-party open-source projects. Miniconda is essentially an installer for an empty conda environment, containing only Conda and its dependencies, so that you can install what you need from scratch.\n",

    "**Reality: Conda's creators pushed Python's standard packaging to its limits for over a decade, and only created a second tool when it was clear it was the only reasonable way forward.**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#the-zen-of-python), when doing anything in Python \"There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it.\" So why would the creators of ``conda`` muddy the field by introducing a new way to install Python packages? Why didn't they contribute back to the Python community and improve ``pip`` to overcome its deficiencies?\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, that is exactly what they did. Prior to 2012, the developers of the PyData/SciPy ecosystem went to great lengths to work within the constraints of the package management solutions developed by the Python community.\n",
    "As far back as 2001, the NumPy project [forked distutils](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/master/numpy/distutils) in an attempt to make it handle the complex requirements of a NumPy distribution.\n",
    "They bundled a large portion of [NETLIB](http://netlib.org/liblist.html) into a single monolithic Python package (you might know this as [SciPy](http://scipy.org)), in effect creating a distribution-as-python-package to circumvent the fact that Python's distribution tools cannot manage these extra-Python dependencies in any meaningful way.\n",
    "An entire generation of scientific Python users spent countless hours struggling with the installation hell created by this exercise of forcing a square peg into a round hole – and those were just ones lucky enough to be using Linux.\n",
    "If you were on Windows, forget about it.\n",
    "To read some of the details about these pain-points and how they led to Conda, I'd suggest Travis Oliphant's [2013 blog post](http://technicaldiscovery.blogspot.com/2013/12/why-i-promote-conda.html) on the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why didn't Conda's creators just *talk* to the Python packaging folks and figure out these challenges together? As it turns out, they did.\n",
    "\n",
    "The genesis of Conda came after Guido van Rossum was invited to speak at the inaugural PyData meetup in 2012; in a Q&A on the subject of packaging difficulties, he told us that when it comes to packaging, \"it really sounds like your needs are so unusual compared to the larger Python community that you're just better off building your own\" ([See video of this discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjXJLVINsSA&feature=youtu.be&t=3555)).\n",
    "Even while following this nugget of advice from the BDFL, the PyData community continued dialog and collaboration with core Python developers on the topic: one more public example of this was the invitation of CPython core developer Nick Coghlan to keynote at SciPy 2014 ([See video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVzjVqr_Bzs)). He gave an excellent talk which specifically discusses pip and conda in the context of the \"unsolved problem\" of software distribution, and mentions the value of having multiple means of distribution tailored to the needs of specific users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Far from insinuating that Conda is divisive, Nick and others at the Python Packaging Authority officially [recognize conda](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#conda) as one of many important redistributors of Python code, and are working hard to better enable such tools to work seamlessly with the Python Package Index."

    "- conda environments integrate management of different Python versions, including installation and updating of Python itself. Virtualenvs must be created upon an existing, externally managed Python executable.\n",

    "- Rather than environments built on symlinks – which break the isolation of the virtualenv and can be flimsy at times for non-Python dependencies – conda-envs are true isolated environments within a single executable path.\n",
    "- While virtualenvs are not compatible with conda packages, conda environments are *entirely* compatible with pip packages. First ``conda install pip``, and then you can ``pip install`` any available package within that environment. You can even [explicitly list pip packages](https://github.com/conda/conda-env/#environment-file-example) in conda environment files, meaning the full software stack is entirely reproducible from a single environment metadata file.\n",

    "This appears not to be some fundamental incompatibility between conda and virtualenv, but rather related to some subtle inconsistencies in the build process, and thus is potentially fixable (see [conda Issue 1367](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/1367) and [anaconda Issue 498](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/anaconda-issues/issues/498), for example).\n",

    "Compiled binaries spotlight the other essential piece of conda: the ability to meaningfully track non-Python dependencies.\n",
    "Because pip's dependency tracking is limited to Python packages, the main way of doing this within wheels is to bundle released versions of dependencies with the Python package binary, which makes updating such dependencies painful (recent security updates to OpenSSL come to mind). Additionally, conda includes a true dependency resolver, a component which pip [currently lacks](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988).\n",

It is [definitely a possibility](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev/status/765583477597089792).\n"

    "## Postscript: Which Tool Should I Use?\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope I've convinced you that conda and pip both have a role to play within the Python community. With that behind us, which should you use if you're starting out? The answer depends on what you want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you have an existing system Python installation and you want to install packages in or on it, use pip+virtualenv**. For example, perhaps you used ``apt`` or another system package manager to install Python, along with some packages linked to system tools that are not (yet) easily installable via conda or pip. Pip+virtualenv will allow you to install new Python packages and build environments on top of that existing distribution, and you should be able to rely on your system package manager for any difficult-to-install dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to flexibly manage a multi-language software stack and don't mind using an isolated environment, use conda**. Conda's multi-language dependency management and cross-platform binary installations can do things in this situation that pip cannot do.\n",
    "A huge benefit is that for most packages, the result will be immediately compatible with multiple operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to install Python packages within an Isolated environment, pip+virtualenv and conda+conda-env are mostly interchangeable**. This is the overlap region where both tools shine in their own way. That being said, I tend to prefer conda in this situation: Conda's uniform, cross-platform, full-stack management of multiple parallel Python environments with robust dependency management has proven to be an *incredible* time-saver in my research, my teaching, and my software development work.\n",
    "Additionally, I find that my needs and the needs of my colleagues more often stray into areas of conda's strengths (management of non-Python tools and dependencies) than into areas of pip's strengths (environment-agnostic Python package management).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, years ago I spent nearly a quarter with a colleague trying to install the complicated (non-Python) software stack that powers the [megaman package](https://github.com/mmp2/megaman), which we were developing together.\n",
    "The result of all our efforts was a single non-reproducible working stack on a single machine.\n",
    "Then conda-forge was introduced. We went through the process again, this time creating a [conda recipe](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/277/files), from which a [conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/megaman-feedstock) was built.\n",
    "We now have a cross-platform solution that will install a working version of the package and its dependencies with a single command, in seconds, on nearly any computer.\n",
    "If there is a way to build and distribute software with that kind of dependency graph seamlessly with pip+PyPI, I haven't seen it."
